# DPDLammpsInput

This is a very simple tool to generate the lammps input data file for md/dpd simulation.

It is only dependent on the standard python3 environment.

No py plug-ins are required.

However, it requires Packmol.

Dihedral and improper constrains has some problems.

Box generating and format conversion are not complete.

Have fun!
